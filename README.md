# IRONHACK - Final_Project

In this project, my goal was to build a dashboard from the results of the last four French presidential elections, focusing mainly on the abstention.
I have used official public data for this project.

I have scrapped the website to retrieve the hyperlinks to the source files of the detailed results of the 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017 elections.
The download of the files was also automated in the "web_scraping_for_datasets' notebook.

After cleaning the data, I gathered all data sets in one big set cumulating the 8 rounds of elections (2 rounds per year) and moved on to Tableau to build visualization from it + a dashboard. I then integrated my viz in a story to present my work to my cohort.
